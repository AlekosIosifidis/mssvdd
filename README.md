#  Multimodal Subspace Support Vector Data Description
This repository is for Multimodal Subspace Support Vector Data Description.
The codes are provided as .m (matlab) files to be executed in matlab.
The codes are provided without any warranty or gurantee.
see demo.m for example usage of the code.
Please contact fahad.sohrab@tuni.fi for any issues.

# Requirements
MS-SVDD requires *LIBSVM for SVDD*. Before executing the codes, make sure that correct version (3.22) of *LIBSVM for SVDD* is installed already. In order to install *LIBSVM for SVDD*  Please download zip file from [HERE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/svdd/libsvm-svdd-3.22.zip), put sources into libsvm-3.22 available [HERE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/oldfiles/libsvm-3.22.zip), and make the code. For more details about how to install libsvm, please refer [HERE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/#libsvm_for_svdd_and_finding_the_smallest_sphere_containing_all_data)
